<p>Visualizations are effective for communicating data because humans are visually-oriented. Our brains have evolved to process visual information and identify patterns. It’s far easier for us to spot patterns in bar charts or scatterplots than in massive sets of tabulated data. Furthermore, the way the visualization is presented can highlight different patterns, leading viewers to draw different conclusions from the same data. Using visualizations allows us to both communicate data and control the patterns we wish to emphasize.

Data visualizations reliant on variations in length, width, and position tend to be more effective at encoding data, such as bar charts or lollipop charts. They’re generally preferable to visualizations reliant upon changes in area, angle, line weight, or color. This is because its easier for our brains to compare lengths and positions than other visual variables. Pinpointing that one bar is longer than another is easy, while figuring out which section of a pie chart is larger can be difficult.

One tradeoff Cairo asks us to consider is whether we wish to emphasize the big picture or the details. Area-based charts can be enough for communicating a general sense of the data. If that’s all we wish to accomplish, a pie chart or stacked area chart may be adequate. But if we wish to highlight smaller details, such as comparisons between individual categories, then length-based charts are preferable. Cairo also asks us to consider the tradeoff between aesthetic appeal and clarity. Sometimes a kind of chart can look pretty, but it’s less effective at communicating patterns.

Another important point which Cairo made is that we should show our visualizations to others and seek feedback. He argues that personal feedback, even informal feedback, can be even more valuable than the textbook visualization rules which designers rely upon. I’m not sure that I completely agree with that. Informal feedback from a small group of people may not be representative of the general audience a visualization is intended for. The more formal visualization principles were laid out by experts after meticulous, scientific examination. I’m more inclined to abide by principles supported by scientific research over the offhand opinions of a few individuals. I’m not saying individual feedback should be completely discarded, but I’m saying that individual feedback should be taken with a grain of salt. If some informal feedback contradicts formal visualization design guidelines, I think we should still lean towards trusting the formal guidelines unless the informal feedback is overwhelmingly negative.
